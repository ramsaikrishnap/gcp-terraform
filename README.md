# Terraform with Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

## What is Terraform?

Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool created by HashiCorp. It allows you to define and provision infrastructure resources using a declarative configuration language. With Terraform, you can manage resources on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and other cloud providers.

## Uses of Terraform with GCP

1. **Cloud Resource Management**: Provision and manage GCP resources like Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, and Cloud SQL.
2. **Network Infrastructure**: Set up Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), subnets, and firewall rules.
3. **Kubernetes Clusters**: Deploy and manage Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters.
4. **Serverless Applications**: Set up Cloud Functions and Cloud Run services.
5. **IAM and Security**: Manage IAM roles, service accounts, and security policies.

## Installation

To install Terraform, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [official Terraform downloads page](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
2. Download the package for your operating system.
3. Extract the downloaded zip file.
4. Move the `terraform` binary to a directory included in your system's PATH.

For macOS and Linux users, you can use package managers:

- macOS (using Homebrew):
  ```
  brew tap hashicorp/tap
  brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform
  ```

- Linux (using apt):
  ```
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common
  wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
  echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install terraform
  ```

Verify the installation by running:
```
terraform version
```

## Authentication Methods for GCP

There are several ways to authenticate Terraform with GCP:

1. **Google Cloud SDK**:
   - Install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
   - Run `gcloud auth application-default login`
   - Set the project: `gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID`

   In your Terraform configuration:
   ```hcl
   provider "google" {
     project = "your-project-id"
     region  = "us-central1"
   }
   ```

2. **Service Account Key File**:
   - Create a service account in the GCP Console
   - Generate a JSON key for the service account
   - Save the JSON key file securely

   In your Terraform configuration:
   ```hcl
   provider "google" {
     credentials = file("path/to/your/service-account-key.json")
     project     = "your-project-id"
     region      = "us-central1"
   }
   ```

3. **Google Cloud Workload Identity Federation**:
   - Set up Workload Identity Federation in GCP
   - Configure your CI/CD platform or on-premises environment

   In your Terraform configuration:
   ```hcl
   provider "google" {
     project                     = "your-project-id"
     region                      = "us-central1"
     impersonate_service_account = "your-service-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
   }
   ```

4. **HashiCorp Vault**:
   - Set up HashiCorp Vault with the GCP secrets engine
   - Configure Vault to generate GCP service account keys

   In your Terraform configuration:
   ```hcl
   provider "vault" {
     address = "http://vault.example.com:8200"
   }

   data "vault_generic_secret" "gcp_credentials" {
     path = "gcp/key/my-service-account"
   }

   provider "google" {
     credentials = data.vault_generic_secret.gcp_credentials.data["private_key_data"]
     project     = "your-project-id"
     region      = "us-central1"
   }
   ```

## Basic Terraform Commands with Sample Outputs

Here are some essential Terraform commands along with sample outputs for GCP:

1. `terraform init`: Initialize a Terraform working directory
   ```
   $ terraform init

   Initializing the backend...

   Initializing provider plugins...
   - Finding latest version of hashicorp/google...
   - Installing hashicorp/google v4.67.0...
   - Installed hashicorp/google v4.67.0 (signed by HashiCorp)

   Terraform has been successfully initialized!
   ```

2. `terraform plan`: Generate and show an execution plan
   ```
   $ terraform plan

   Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
     + create

   Terraform will perform the following actions:

     # google_compute_instance.example will be created
     + resource "google_compute_instance" "example" {
         + name         = "example-instance"
         + machine_type = "e2-medium"
         + zone         = "us-central1-a"
         + ...
       }

   Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
   ```

3. `terraform apply`: Builds or changes infrastructure
   ```
   $ terraform apply

   # ... (plan output) ...

   Do you want to perform these actions?
     Terraform will perform the actions described above.
     Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

   Enter a value: yes

   google_compute_instance.example: Creating...
   google_compute_instance.example: Creation complete after 45s [id=projects/your-project/zones/us-central1-a/instances/example-instance]

   Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
   ```

4. `terraform destroy`: Destroy Terraform-managed infrastructure
   ```
   $ terraform destroy

   # ... (plan output) ...

   Do you really want to destroy all resources?
     Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
     There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

   Enter a value: yes

   google_compute_instance.example: Destroying... [id=projects/your-project/zones/us-central1-a/instances/example-instance]
   google_compute_instance.example: Destruction complete after 30s

   Destroy complete! Resources: 1 destroyed.
   ```

5. `terraform validate`: Validates the Terraform files
   ```
   $ terraform validate

   Success! The configuration is valid.
   ```

6. `terraform fmt`: Rewrites config files to canonical format
   ```
   $ terraform fmt

   main.tf
   variables.tf
   ```

7. `terraform show`: Inspect Terraform state or plan
   ```
   $ terraform show

   # google_compute_instance.example:
   resource "google_compute_instance" "example" {
       name         = "example-instance"
       machine_type = "e2-medium"
       zone         = "us-central1-a"
       ...
   }
   ```

## Terraform Workspace Commands

Terraform workspaces allow you to manage multiple states for a single configuration. Here are the workspace-related commands:

- `terraform workspace list`: List available workspaces
- `terraform workspace select [NAME]`: Select a workspace
- `terraform workspace new [NAME]`: Create a new workspace
- `terraform workspace delete [NAME]`: Delete an existing workspace
- `terraform workspace show`: Show the name of the current workspace

Example usage:
```
$ terraform workspace list
  default
  development
* production

$ terraform workspace new staging
Created and switched to workspace "staging"!

$ terraform workspace select production
Switched to workspace "production".
```

## Methods to Pass Variables to Terraform

There are several ways to pass variables to Terraform:

1. **Command Line Flags**: 
   ```
   terraform apply -var="instance_type=e2-medium" -var="instance_count=5"
   ```

2. **Variable Files**: Create a file named `terraform.tfvars` or any file with `.tfvars` extension.
   ```
   # contents of terraform.tfvars
   instance_type = "e2-medium"
   instance_count = 5
   ```
   Then run:
   ```
   terraform apply
   ```
   Or specify a different var-file:
   ```
   terraform apply -var-file="testing.tfvars"
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**: Prefix your variable name with `TF_VAR_`.
   ```
   export TF_VAR_instance_type="e2-medium"
   export TF_VAR_instance_count=5
   terraform apply
   ```

4. **Default Values**: In your `variables.tf` file, you can specify default values.
   ```hcl
   variable "instance_type" {
     default = "e2-medium"
   }
   ```

5. **Interactive Input**: If you don't provide a value for a variable, Terraform will interactively ask you to input the value.

## Best Practices for Terraform with GCP

1. Use version control for your Terraform configurations
2. Implement remote state storage using Google Cloud Storage
3. Use modules to organize and reuse your code
4. Always run `terraform plan` before `terraform apply`
5. Use variables and outputs to make your configurations more flexible
6. Implement state locking to prevent concurrent state operations
7. Use Terraform workspaces for managing multiple environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod)
8. Follow GCP's principle of least privilege when setting up service accounts for Terraform
9. Use data sources to fetch existing GCP resources instead of hardcoding values
10. Regularly update Terraform and the Google provider to benefit from new features and security updates

Remember to refer to the [official Terraform documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/index.html) and [Google Cloud documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs) for more detailed information and advanced usage.
